        description: "Hi everyone, my name is Lakshmi Palchuri and I am a computer science major at hunter college. I have always been an avid reader, and  I particularly enjoy Y.A. And mystery Novels. “Remember Me” has been one of my favorite books. If you love books about the journey that the protagonist takes to find themselves, this is a perfect read for you because the protagonist quite literally forgets about 3 years of her life and wakes up to see that she is a completely different person from 3 years ago. This book is somehow insightful and lighthearted at the same time and it’s a good reminder to everyone that it’s important to grow and love and respect yourself!",

        description: "Hello all, my name is Nuzhat khan and I am a CS major at Hunter College. I enjoy music and watching tv in my free time. One of my favorite books is “Brave New World” by Aldous Huxley. I have read this book in high school and it left a great impression on me. It's a great book on dystopian science fiction and it shows the effects of a social hierarchy based on intelligence on a society. It’s an eye opening book that really makes you think about the effects of technology in our world. The books 1984, Farenheit 451 and Brave New World are known as the dystopian classic triangle. If you enjoy this type of book, you should definitely pick it up for a read.",

So, if you like mystery books and end up enjoying this book, there are four books in the series to be put in your reading list.",
