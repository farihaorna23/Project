Very helpful (You can even upload the code into the other repo where everyone can have access to it)
1————git add .
2————git commit -m "updated version"
3————git push https://github.com/mahirmahboob/Backend.git


I added the datasets in a folder called dumps20210924. All you have to do is drag the folder out to desktop and then import the data in SqlWorkbench

All the endpoint should work. You can use Postman Desktop to connect to the backend.
I’m using http://localhost:5000
If you want to test login then first you have to signup for an account. 
If you don’t want to signup for an account then you can use my username & password 
Username: mahirmahboob
Password: password

Also, for my SqlWorkbench, the password is ‘password’  (server.js ——line 42). If you have a different password for your
Localhost then update line 42.

To run the server, you type node server.js in vscode terminal
